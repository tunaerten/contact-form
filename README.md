### What I learned

I struggled quite a bit with styling radio buttons and checkboxes, but after some research, I think I’ve figured it out. Other than that, I didn’t face many challenges. I realize now that I should plan and write the error messages in the initial HTML structure next time. Since I didn’t do that, I had to rewrite the code from scratch. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable project. I’d appreciate any advice you can offer!
